If there's an opening for a work study position, that's super super helpful because you get to see the same people everyday, so you have no other choice but to talk to them.

      "Honestly, that's how I feel about Atlas Shrugged rn 😂 I'm currently reading Atlas Shrugged and I actually love it, it changed my life.

      "I started to my read of AS during my senior year of high school (I'm in college now). I was always a bit of a slacker and completely disorganized during my schooling. I would always do the bare minimum and improvise when I couldn't even do that anymore. I was a mess. But I read Atlas Shrugged BECAUSE I didn't agree with it. I didn't like the characters and I didn't really like all the politics involved, but I kept reading because the book made me feel uncomfortable. I felt like the characters were over-the-top and unrealistic but I feel that's because they were supposed to be. They were supposed to be an idea, something that the audience could strive for. I saw that Dagny and Rearden had so much work ethic and stubbornness and I wanted to incorporate that into my own life. The characters made me want to be a better human being. I saw all the flaws in myself and accepted that I needed to change. In my opinion, AS is a story about human greatness and what we're able to accomplish if we just set our minds to it. I know that there is a lot of added on philosophies but I feel like you can take something positive out of Ayn Rand's work if you just focus on that.\n",

      "All in all, AS is one of my favorite books because it made me a better person and I'm not about to just ignore that.

I'd be happy for them to be 5 again like the good ol' days, but ofc I'm aware there could be controversy with having Jae's mistakes tied to the band and respect if they wish to stay as 4. As others said, it's pretty childish for people to fight over the whole thing as if they're the ones in control over the future of the band; Day6 are literally grown men soon to be approaching their 30s and are capable of making their own logical decisions. It's their choice in how they want to grow and move forward as a team and as individuals. As someone stated, we're merely the consumers, not the executives.

      "i0gjsqt One of my friends posted a clip of their Shoot Me MV and it piqued my interest. I loved Shoot Me and decided to give the rest of their Youth: pt. 1 album a try. I loved all the songs on that album too. This was back in July 2018, but after the first listen, I sorta just left it at that. Then in December 2018, I found their Buzzfeed interview. That's when I found out about their days gone by MV and I LOVED it. I ended up binge-watching and binge-listening to all their MVs, fanmade compilations, and JaeSix videos (we miss JaeSix :'-) ). Although I normally listen to an entire album before deciding if I want to buy a physical copy, I confidently bought the Remember Us album after only listening to the title track. I just had this feeling I'd love all the songs on that album (and I did! It's actually one of my favorite Day6 albums and era!!). \n",

I may not be so involved with Day6 anymore in regards to their social lives and such (only listening to their music and new releases), but I am rooting for Jae's character growth, as cliche or overused that phrase may sound. I believe he is geniune, whether he's been good or done/said bad things; he's a guy who means well but makes stupid mistakes due to lack of discretion. I personally do believe he's learned from this and will take steps to eventually become better and learn to let go of things such as his anger or resentment.

      "Someone shared this either here on Reddit or YouTube before, but I want to reiterate their thoughts on this post. I find it interesting that in their dreams, Arnold and Helga each have a certain idea of a married life together based on some extremity (which makes sense since they're just kids and are making sense of things based on their limited, inexperienced knowledge of what love and marriage really mean). Arnold pictures their life to be a total nightmare in which Helga is completely cold and uncaring. Helga pictures their married life to be a complete Disney princess fantasy with Arnold doing nothing but tell her sweet nothings all the time (OP of the discussion described Arnold as being an 'emotional crutch' basically). Both versions are obviously unrealistic. When we get to Phoebe's vision in the end, we see a more realistic version of their married life that is neither a nightmare or an ideal fantasy full of love poems and roses; they simply hold hands united and enjoy each other's company, which I believe helps to show what love and marriage is really about. 1639805811.0 HeyArnold 6\n",

Yeah, I know it's not the best fic out there but I had to remind myself that I don't write for others, I write because my silly little characters will keep running laps in my head if I don't do something about it. It's counter-productive to get stressed over the hobby that you picked up for destressing. My advice is to keep pushing! Upload your fic even if you think it could have been better!

The peloton was of course infuriated by someone breaking their unwritten rule, so later down the road, when this rider needed to take a pee break himself, the peloton caught up with him, stole his bike from the side of the road, and carried it a mile down the road, at which point they chucked it into the bushes.

      "Body stuffed with newspapers — the most common misconception about this case. The people make it seem that he was found stuffed with missing newspapers, but really what happened was that after his body was exhumed for a second autopsy they found that his organs were removed and body was stuffed. Newspapers aren’t uncommon to put into a body, and it is cheaper and more convenient than saw dust or stuffing. The upper hand found the funeral home was not at fault for this as it was once a common practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rolled up in a gym mat — Kendrick Johnson’s initial cause of death was determined to be ‘positional asphyxia’, a form of suffocation. The interpretation of how he died was that he went to reach for shoes that were inside vertical rolled up gym mats and he was stuck upside down and died that way. Most people, and even I read this as he was rolled into a gym mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause of death: blunt force trauma — a 2nd or 3rd autopsy (can’t recall which one) determined a 2-3 centimeter bruise on KJs neck made his cause of death blunt force trauma. This doctor has previously has an interesting history of unethical practices in his work, so his credibility is questionable. \n",

      "The conspiracy is that he was murdered by a classmate and the classmates brother, and their dad who was an FBI agent helped cover it up. There’s claims of confessions and letters, and Kendricks mother recently had stated that the case was reopening. I have sources if anyone wants more. \n",
      "\n",

      "hud6r30 Base model for 6k and it’s a 1.6 …. Well for starters look at how bad this “minimum “ rust is . Check for leaks, as harder to get oil leaks like the oil pan and front and rear main seals will cost you a lot of time, patience, and skill to do . If you don’t want to do it expect to pay a lot to get it done at a shop . He says it needs new pads ask him if he meant the front or the rear. If he meant all of them I would probably get new rotors and pads all around which can cost you anywhere from 150 to 300. He says those ugly wheels need new tires which will be around 300+ . See if the original daisies have good tires on them . Check not only for thread but also the Manufacture date . If they are older than 4 years I would not run those . At that point I would suggest you getting new tires for the daisies as they might be cheaper since they are a smaller wheel . I could keep going but you get the gist . Miata’s are cheap and reliable only if you make them . Buying a 30 year old car will come at a cost and I would not endure those costs if the car is already at 6k. But hey that’s just me .

      "lx71r0i If you want to make a career out of Vocaloid, my advice isn't for you, but as an artist who decided years ago that I didn't want my passion to be spent on the whims of whoever's giving me money(and instead choosing a career that I don't despise conceptually so I can make money and still have art as a hobby), trying to get big on any social media with your art is just asking for trouble. I know it's easier said than done, you care about the art you make, you put your time and effort into it, but if the algorithm doesn't happen to decide to show your art to thousands of people who happen to be the right audience for it, you won't reach many people. And if you're looking to views or likes for validation of the quality of your art, you're gonna have a bad time. \n",

      "In my opinion, if you're a hobbyist/amateur and just make music for the love of the craft and want other people to *be able to* see it, just post stuff to YouTube and whatever other free video and audio hosting sites you want, and maybe make an Instagram or Twitter account dedicated to updates on your work if you want to further spread the word. Don't fret too much over the numbers, and don't force yourself to make art that you don't have the energy for just to keep engagement up. \n",

      "\n",
      "First of all, where I currently live, most of the year it's too hot out for me to wear Lolita(as of writing this it's about a week into Fall/Autumn and it's 92°F outside). My blouses get drenched in sweat if I spend a little time outside with the weather like that, which just leaves me both uncomfortable and gross for the rest of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I currently don't have the budget to get many dresses, nor do I really want to get more before I meet some of my fitness goals. I have like 5 coords that I can actually wear at the moment, and two dresses plus a couple blouses that I really want to wear but can't currently fit in(and they're not made any larger), so it's not l have a ton of options in my wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, I simply don't have the time and energy to do a full coord most days. I'm in Uni right now, and I commonly wake up with about 15 minutes before I need to leave for class, and if I do wake up with time to do more than just put on a t-shirt/sweater and jeans/shorts, I more commonly use that to clean up and eat breakfast. Also I don't like the concept of machine washing most of my Lolita garments, but hand washing is its own ordeal, especially since I share my bathroom with a roommate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to be working in tech once I'm out of school, so I'll probably be able to dress however I want(with a little bit of restrictions, but considering the lack of exposed skin and effort with Lolita, I don't think I'll have any issues there) and my sleep schedule won't be nearly as whack as it is right now. And I'll have big girl money to spend on dresses! That said, I probably still won't be a lifestyle Lolita bc I enjoy other styles too. I'm really into the mall goth style(and goth music), with my demonias and off brand Tripp pants and a band tee being one of my go-to outfits in a normal day, and I also just like cute sweaters with pleated skirts or jeans, and graphic tees generally....I have way too much clothing. 1727724341.0 Lolita 4\n",

I talked to each of the people beside me in line and then the little group of people I was next to during the concert(including helping one of them shed a bit of her cosplay bc wig headache is so real), and man.

Ichika doesn't really have anyone else that she's hanging out with, but Honami and Shiho do. Shiho seems like the kind of person who isn't agreeable enough to be really popular, just to have a couple dedicated friends/friend groups that she feels very close to while others outside of her circles see her as some combination of weird and cool.

      "l3w8aiz Some of A&P does come back but personally it wasn’t as detailed as it was in A&P 1 and 2, what I found challenging was learning all the signs and symptoms and sometimes the disease pathology (you get a full page cheat sheet to write whatever so don’t worry too much). Definitely watch Hughes videos they help a lot especially if you are an auditory learner (writing notes in class also helps). I would sometimes make flash cards for the diseases and write the signs and symptoms (making mnemonics also helps with learning/memorizing signs and symptoms) but those can take a while to make so towards the end I decided to make my own learning objectives based on the notes given. The practice exams were also very helpful they help you see what you know and what you don’t. Personally I don’t think it’s as difficult as A&P but definitely study on time to avoid cramming. \n",
