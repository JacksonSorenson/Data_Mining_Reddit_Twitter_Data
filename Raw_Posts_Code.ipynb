A woman was also walking around there, looking just a little desperate. He motioned for me to stop and help him with something. His truck ran out of gas and he needed help to get a container. To be more specific, cash. He'd pay me double later, he promised. He'd go to the cafeteria of the school and pay me double, he repeated. First huge red flag that I was aware, but chose to ignore. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and carried on asking him questions. By the time he stuttered giving me a fake number (because I called it right on the spot and it rang, yet he said it was dead), said he was an uncannily common name (Mike Williams), and his \"wife\" was looking for someone to help them as well instead of staying with us, I realized I was being scammed while it happened. Unfortunately, I stupidly got out my wallet before making sure he was legitimate, and I felt like asking him for my $8 back was risking something worse. It might not be a lot, but for me it makes a big difference. He was smart, though. I can't deny that. Textbook scam. \n",

      "This is the story of a man named Tim. Tim was really close to his neighbor, Allen, who was a carpenter. Tim was so close to Allen that he was one of the only people to call him \"Al\" (a nickname that Allen personally hated). One morning \"Al\" was chopping off a tree with a chainsaw when he accidentally cut off his arm. The ambulance rushed \"Al\" to the hospital but sadly he died of blood loss. To Tim's horror, he realized that they forgot to take his arm. Tim missed his neighbor alot so he decided to keep the arm to himself. But every morning, at exactly 7:30, the arm would frantically search for the chainsaw that separated it from its body and this always woke up Tim. I guess you could say... That Tim would wake up every morning because of his AL-ARM!\n",

I've seen all the stories of cats miraculously appearing after 4 years and I've seen so much advice on how to find them sooner. We are following every bit of it already. Yesterday, however, I may have over-exerted myself. I spent hours searching the (decently sized) backyard destroying so many sunflowers along the way (that needed to be done regardless, but damn if Little Man isn't a good motivator). That + all the crying has made me absolutely physically and mentally exhausted. I know he's a strong boy, I know he's probably fine, I'm sure he's just gonna walk in like nothing happened as soon as I post this and I'll quietly delete it out of embarrassment. We live in a slightly more rural than suburban neighborhood, there's a decent amount of outdoor pets and strays that everyone minds their business with. Odds are no one has bothered to go out of their way to take him to a shelter, and he's wearing a collar (unnamed) but I would imagine anyone with decency wouldn't have opted to keep him. Still, I'm so nervous. I'm sure 2-3 days is nothing for him but it's killing me, it feels like its been 2-3 decades. \n",

Is it possible that these jerks have taken over my cats territory? Did he get kicked out of his own house? Could they be the reason he isn't coming back?

      "For a certain client, I charged a fixed rate per square foot over the past few years as I completed projects for them (this number being around what other small companies like mine charge). Now, they're asking for detailed invoices stating the price for rebar, formwork, grading, etc. I ran the numbers based on industry prices (ex: 50 cents per installing linear foot of formwork) and I'd be charging a significant amount less than what I currently charge. When it comes to estimating, what portion of the rate is a \"company fee\"?  As in, lets say the total details come out to $3.50 per sqft but everyone usually charges $6 per sqft. Do those companies just jack up the individual detail prices to get to the $6 per sqft? Or do they specify a \"company/labor\" fee that fills in the rest?\n",

For context, my partner last night went and tried chocolate shrooms and this was his first time trying it. I took him to his friends house so I could pick him up. He was very panicky and from the few times he called me, he couldn’t even be on his phone and he would be out of breath and I would have to talk to his friends. \n",

      "After I picked him up, he was having a lot of ups and downs. (We smoke weed daily and he told me he had also been high before trying the shrooms, so I’m not sure if that interacted.) Now after his high he has been different. He’s depressed, and his mind is distracted. He’s upset, fragile, and sentimental about every situation he has going on in his life right now. When I saw him today he was extremely different and couldn’t even have a conversation with me. I’m pretty sure he’s going through disassociation—I had the same experience when I tried weed for the first time. I tried my best to comfort him by distractions and acting normal. Trying my best not to overwhelm him so much. But I just have no idea how to console him and how to comfort him as he recovers from his experience.

(First— I am Latino so don’t think I’m being judgmental) but starting off the show with a character being Latina, is great, but making her talk about her being Latina feels so forced. Especially her wearing a Selena shirt in the Pilot. There’s more to Latino characters that them just constantly saying they’re Latino. \n",

Jenni doesn’t want anyone to know, because she knows she’s wrong for that, and Pauly tells Ron that Jenni brought Jen out there (which is totally justifiable) and Jenni gets me so mad throughout the entire series but especially season 3.

So, I decided to watch Snooki & Jwoww for the first time. I’m on the third season, and by now it’s very very clear to me how toxic Jenni and Rogers relationship is and one thing I notice a lot is that Jenni absolutely hates having sex with Roger. Like never has and she always has excuses for it, (which is fine, because no woman should do it if they don’t want to) but it’s also crazy how leading up to her and Roger getting engaged, she was very… materialistic(?) with it. She mentions how she really just wants the ring, and loves the idea of getting married but definitely shows no love with Roger. Knowing this now after being a complete JSFV fan, I can see why their relationship ended. They had a lot of problems and broadcasted it on Snooki & Jwoww.

At the pool party 24 is asking a lot of questions about Angelina and her sex life with Chris and how they don’t do it often. I understand the roommates talking about it, joking around, in the past, but 24 has been there for 24 minutes and gets really personal with Angelina and it bothers her. Even Vinny and Deena say it’s too personal to talk about but so far nobody has stuck up for her and Jwoww is just loooving this. It shows in the preview that later on in the episode Jwoww argues with Angelina because she’s “disrespecting her man” but all she’s doing is setting a boundary. \n",

      "jhohbx PLEASE HELP Okay so where do I start, my dad bought a 1999 CLK 430 (Hardtop)  about 4 years ago and I've been using it since may. At the time it had 199,990 miles and now it has 210,600 miles. The car wasn't in good shape but over the months I've had it I've done basic service to at least make it run smoother like resealing the bottom oil pan, doing an oil change, replacing all 4 tires, and just keeping her well maintained because my dad didn't. The thing that's always been an issue with her are the electrical issues. So I'm about to explain the dumbest, weirdest problem I've ever seen in a car. First the relays to this weird clicking sometimes when I start the car and that causes the turning signals to not work. The windshield wipers don't work and if I move the knob ,it will make relay clicking noises and it will cause the turning signals to not work. If I use the rear shade button, it will cause the radio to not work, turns off any dome lights I have on, and it will cause the turning signals not to work. If i change the transmission setting (standard or wet setting) it will cause the turning signals to fail. If i open the glovebox, the turning signals will not work (Okay note when i say the turning signals don't work i mean that if I select right will flash left and if i select left nothing will happen.) A passenger cannot use their seatbelt because it will cause the turning signal problem which is the shittiest part because i want to ensure the safety of my passenger but that means i cant use my turn signals which can lead to a ticket ...... When I use the 12v socket for my bluetooth adapter it will cause the turn signal problem. Last but not least sometimes it wont shift out 1st and after 3000rpm it will lose all power and i have to coast for a bit for it to regain power and ability to shift. Okay so that was alot but im sure everything (except for maybe the last issue) all have to do with a bad ground or maybe water got in the car. Im just hoping anyone can help me find the wiring diagrams for it or could just help me solve any issue i just had. Its hard to look for solutions when its so much to explain to google to look up lmao. All I wished for was a simple 5 speed Integra, but instead the universe gave me this issue of a car so until I have that integra ,I need to deal with this so please anything helps ..😢 1603605496.0 mercedes_benz 0\n",

Like being frustrated and annoyed that you're running around trying to help and just continuously being told \"nope that's not it\" is fully understandable, but WHY are you focusing so much on this old lady not remembering your name WHEN YOU JUST MET HER and she doesn't even correctly remember her caregiver's name.

You have this lightly sweet, soft, squishy blob that often holds stuff like red bean paste or fruits, and you've got ice cream in all its glory. Why wouldn't you put them together, right? But my experience with buying and consuming mochi ice cream has been...kinda sad. The first time i got it, it was good! The mochi broke a little and the tiny freezer in my dorm fridge barely kept the ice cream from being fully liquid, but it was soft and tasted good. Since then, I've had mochi ice cream three other times and each time the ice cream was watery or a slushy consistency and the outside was tough and dry, even after letting the ice cream melt.

      "n2u6la I think i might be thinning my hair??? I've always messed with my hair. Back when it was long, i would brush the ends along my face and lips(i know, kinda gross, but i was a kid) bc it was soft and i liked the feel. Back in sophomore year of high school, though, i cut it short enough that I couldn't really reach my lips, so that stopped being a soothing thing for me, though it was still long enough for me to twirl it and make little braids like before. I still twirl it sometimes, but I started pulling hairs sometime in junior year, probably bc it was the most academically stressful time of my life, and the most stressful time since I had stopped having my main comfort action with my hair and since I had stopped using much more destructive coping mechanisms in late middle and early high school. Since then(I'm now at the end of my freshman year of uni), my hair pulling habit has just gotten worse.

      "lktv9c Too late to properly introduce new-ish cat, but our old cat still hates her So my family got a kitten(9moF) that we did not intend to get or keep about six months ago. Because of covid closing down small vets and her age when we got her, we couldn't get her spayed until the end of this next month. When we got her, we didn't have much time to plan bc she was practically dumped on us and my parents ended up giving her a really sudden introduction with our older cat(about 8yF) and since then, the older cat, who had already been indoor/outdoor, comes into the house much more scarcely, just to eat, get mad at the kitten and our indoor dog(who she had no real problem with before, just lightly annoyed sometimes), then cry at the door to leave. The kitten is very  invested in whatever the cat is doing and seems to be trying to get along, but the older cat will hiss, growl, spit, and swat(without taking out her claws)whenever she gets too close. Sometimes we'll put the kitten in the bathroom with her food, water and litterbox while the cat is in just so the cat will actually eat instead of immediately leaving. In the past two months, the cat has slowly gotten more indoor time each day, and in the past few days, since it's been freezing, we haven't let her go out. Since she's staying inside all day, we can't keep the kitten locked up the whole time she's here, so they're interacting a lot. And they're not having a good time with it. I understand we botched their introduction and the bathroom situation with the kitten is not good, but I have no idea of a way to remedy this. Another issue is the fact that we may end up keeping the kitten, partially because we're really bad about rescuing animals, saying we'll put them up for adoption eventually, then just...not doing that, but also because our indoor dog like, loves the kitten, bc she finally has someone to play with throughout every day. I don't want the cat to feel unsafe or uncomfortable in her own house, but I also don't want the dog to lose her best friend and get depressed, yaknow?

      "jxkh63 The internet needs to stop pushing \"everyone's attractive!\" And start pushing \"treat everyone the same no matter your attraction to them!\" (Tl:dr just read the title i guess.)This was the original design of the body positivity movement, before that one movement that I don't think I can name without getting my post removed for mentioning *b*s*ty. Part of why I think this is the way it should be is because attraction IS subjective. Some people might be attracted or unattracted to me just because I'm overweight or short or cut my hair into boyish styles, but that's not an issue. The issue comes when people decide to be rude to someone because they find aspects of that person unattractive. The second part of my problem with the \"everyone's attractive\" thing is, what are you supposed to say to a 12 year old who's overweight? \"Oh don't worry, your rolls are sexy!\" Like ew, no! That's about as bad as calling them whatever derogatory word people are using to tear down overweight people nowadays. Not to mention, it's SO messed up to bring down a CHILD for their weight when they're not the ones feeding themselves and most eating disorders occur in younger and/or more impressionable people, of which children are both. I don't really have a conclusion for this i mostly just needed to get this off my mind. 1605855677.0 unpopularopinion 1589\n",

While I will say that may be true of like, middle and high school cheerleaders, and maybe in the 80's, in general, it's not. Every time I see a popular post of a girl's weight loss journey or just a video of her wearing makeup, for every ten comments I see of girls saying she's \"goals\" or just lifting her up, I see three comments from guys that are just calling out blemishes, saying she'll never get a guy looking/wearing makeup/dressing like that, or just being blatantly disrespectful to her for being overweight, then acting like the only girls that deserve respect are the ones they find attractive. There will be the odd comment from a girl with a backhanded compliment, but considering it's about as common as finding a guy saying something nice, they can both be counted as outliers. I'm just so tired of seeing guys INSIST that they have no part in the shittiness of online culture towards women. 1603822015.0 unpopularopinion 33\n",

It was a minor annoyance at first, but now that I actually do get legitimate calls for myself from unknown numbers(yay for being a college student with people actually trying to contact me), I don't have the luxury of just not answering unknown numbers. I have started screening all these calls and that works fine to keep them away, but it's still taking time out of my day to do so. Is there anything I can do to stop this?

      "hzu0gk How can I learn to feel grateful for things instead of guilty?  So I recently realized a problem that I have with personal self help, and it's that anytime I try to think of things that I'm grateful for, I just feel guilty that I have these privelages and opportunities without having had to do anything for them(I'm still living with my parents until college starts and we're pretty firmly in the upper middle class). I used to have the big problem of feeling like I wasn't worth anything and that any effort from others that went towards bettering my life should have been towards literally anyone else, but I went to therapy for that and I'm doing better in that respect. Not perfect, but better. But now that I do think more highly of myself, I still have the problem of the fact that I feel like I need to be doing more to earn the privelages that I already have, not to mention the guilt of knowing that a lot of people my age work way harder, have real responsibilities, and still can't have the kind of life that I live. Like, I know there's nothing wrong with feeling for less fortunate people, but it completely gets in the way of my progress in learning to love myself, and just further screws with my already screwed up self image and dummy depressed brain. 1595996352.0 askatherapist 1\n",

      "hcxjkx Does my cat remember her life before us? My family's current cat was found left at a rest stop on our way to see some family. She was young, abandoned, starving, and had recently given birth. The kittens had already been taken by the time we got there, while she was out getting food. We managed to coax her out from under a walkway with a couple of vending machine snacks and some water, and she didn't put up much of a fight when picked up and put into a box(we didn't have a better way to keep her contained for the rest of the trip), but she sounded very sad. When we got to our relative's house, my mom and I gave her a bath and took her out on a leash to the front yard. While out there she let out a ton of raspy loud meows, and seemed to be looking for her kittens. So she obviously still remembered them then.

      "Trogons are born with an difficult ability they can improve with the energy of other souls, which unlocks facets of their power. Sometimes, trogons don’t find what their ability is until they’re older; some never find out. Power can help an ability improve, but it matters more how the user utilizes it.\n",

      "\n",
      "-Very influenced by surrounding people: Their surrounding company often affects their worldview and makes them susceptible to change opinion about things they don’t hate with a passion. Trogons that become aware of this lose this trait or gain control about it.\n",

      "-They care a lot about the people they like: Trogons are know to be very good friends(Loyal, helpful, and gentle when it matters) to the point they’d destroy their own reputation for their friends to have a happy life.

      "Most of those with violent history happened due to the leading class seeing trogons as a threat to their power, which lead to attempted  extermination of trogons. The fight between those people, and the trogons often ended with a destroyed city, dead leading class, and a few dead trogons.\n",

      "1bz0ssu CC Update on Release Dates for The Wicked Powers and The Eldest Curses, Kickstarter “When I came to the end of The Last Hours, I was “out of contract” — meaning I didn’t have any further Shadowhunter books that were owned by or owed to a publisher.  it was the first time that had happened since, again, 2005. Being out of contract is your one chance to change anything you want to change about your career, and I knew I was going to leave my longtime US publisher of the Shadowhunter books and move to Random House, who published Sword Catcher. […] Normally a writer wouldn’t really address switching publishers — it happens a lot, and most readers don’t care who publishes a book. I’m talking about it now because I know there will be a lot of people who are angry and don’t understand why Ragpicker King is coming out before Last King of Faerie. The short answer is: Ragpicker King has been under contract since it was sold along with Sword Catcher, years ago now, and I’m obligated to get it done when I said I was going to. The books of The Wicked Powers are only just now securely under contract enough to be announced, as you just saw! So Ragpicker King is planned to be turned in in a couple of months, and after that I will be able to focus entirely on The Last King of Faerie (which I already began, but since it was only sold to Knopf last October, I was only able to get started after that). And it takes a a year at least to write a book and another good year or so to publish it, and that gets us to the pub dates we’ve got. I would love if I could get it to you earlier, but multiple factors have brought us to this point, and in the end, it is the best thing for the books, and will produce the best version of those books. I always want to get you my best work — that’s what is important to me above all things.”\n",

      "1bwj2wj The Wicked Powers to be released in Spring 2026, new CC YA Duology series to be published (New York, NY, April 5, 2024)—Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children’s Books, will publish five new books from #1 New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Cassandra Clare, whose novels have sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, been translated into 43 languages, and published in more than 60 countries. The new publications will begin in Spring 2026 with the first book in THE WICKED POWERS trilogy, the sixth and final series in Clare’s 23-book, young adult fantasy franchise The Shadowhunter Chronicles. Also slated for publication with Knopf is a brand-new YA romantasy duology, IN FIRE FORETOLD. The news was announced today by Melanie Nolan, VP and Publisher, Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, who acquired North American rights from Suzie Townsend and Joanna Volpe of New Leaf Literary & Media in a highly competitive auction. Michelle Frey, Senior Executive Editor, Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, will edit both series. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cassandra Clare mesmerized readers across the globe with the publication of City of Bones (2007), the first book in the Mortal Instruments series, and was quickly dubbed the “New Queen of Fantasy” by the Wall Street Journal. The Mortal Instruments became the basis for the far-reaching Shadowhunter Chronicles, an intricately drawn world that has seen global success and has been adapted into both a feature film and television show. The books follow the Shadowhunters, a secretive race of humans born with angel blood, whose mission is to eliminate the demons that plague the Earth. Knopf’s first publishing collaboration with Clare, THE WICKED POWERS (Spring 2026), will follow Kit Herondale, Ty Blackthorn, and Drusilla Blackthorn from The Dark Artifices series as they are drawn into the final massive conflict between the demons and the angels. \n",
      "\n",
      "IN FIRE FORETOLD is a pulse-pounding YA romantasy duology set in a new world with entirely new characters. The story centers a young woman who must learn to control her dangerous magical abilities in order to save her kingdom, all while finding herself torn between two brothers—the kingdom's princes, born to a cursed royal bloodline. The publication date for IN FIRE FORETOLD, as well as news of additional books to come from Cassandra Clare and Knopf, will be announced. \n",
      "\n",
      "Says Cassandra Clare: \"I am delighted to have Knopf and Penguin Random House as my publishers for this last trilogy in the Shadowhunters world. They truly understand what it means—both for the story and for my readers—to wrap up such an epic tale that has been told over so many years. I'm also excited to be launching my next YA series — a kickass portal fantasy that contains a ton of things I love, from a bold and reckless heroine to a magical wasteland filled with terrifying monsters that must be fought, to a love triangle with two very unusual cursed princes. I can't wait for us to bring these stories to the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Says Michelle Frey: “Cassandra Clare is a beloved author whose work has a massive following for good reason: she sucks you into a fully imagined world and never lets go until the last, satisfying page. I have long admired Cassie and am thrilled to be working with her on both the delectable final trilogy in the Shadowhunter Chronicles and the heart-stopping new love triangle she has dreamed up with IN FIRE FORETOLD.”\n",

      "zu5yl8 nothing works I've had oral thrush for close to about 3 months now. It first started showing in October and went to a clinic in the beginning of November. I went to an clinic to go get it diagnosed and they ended up giving me Nystatin cream for it to be applied at the perimeter of both ends if my mouth twice a day, with the nurse saying that the scarring might be permanent. At first I seemed to be reacting to it really well and it even decreased in size to just two small circles say the ends if my mouth. Then after two weeks of steady application or came back flaky and irritated. My mom tried helping me, and she even made a mixture of my Nystatin cream and muropircin (something like that). That seemed to help too, cause the flaky-ness went away and it soothed well, but the raised skin still remained. Then when I would eat I started getting tiny little cuts at the ends, which made me not able to eat properly. So then I just started using muropircin on top of the cuts and on my lips to prevent cutting. Which worked for a while and it even healed. But now my skin is inflamed again back to where I started waking up with flaky ends and cuts and I'm so tired I don't know what to do. I open my cuts every time I eat and this red, raised, inflamed skin is embarrassing to deal with especially this holiday season.

When it comes to the young bucks I just hate them, worst tag team I've seen besides ftr and the new day. They just have matches that are too fast. But to end this rant, was there anyone that everyone loved but you just didn't get. I've met people who didn't care for undertaker but loved kane do I know I can't be the only one in this subject. Lastly if you like the guys I mentioned then good for you but I just don't like them sorry. 1663798164.0 SquaredCircle 0\n",

      "\n",
      "Reviews of the new additions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.   Stacker (2.19)- very good, I would compare it to the the quesadilla but folded to be one large one. I recommend to add Chipotle or Jalapeño Sauce to get more creaminess. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cheesy Double Beef (2.79)- Really good but felt a little uneven with all the ingredients. I only really tasted beef in mine but it was thick and very filling. I recommend to ask to put the Sour Cream on the side when you order and use it as dip. The sour cream was basically non-existent in mine. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Loaded Beef Nachos (2.99)- Basically nachos bell grande but cheaper WITH GUAC. Same amount of chips and everything too. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Double Stacked Taco (1.79)- For being the cheapest new edition, it offers great value. You get amazing crunch from the strips and it is incredibly filling. Adding Sour cream will add some amazing creaminess that will still come out to less than a supreme crunchy taco where i’m from. 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 3 Cheese Chicken Flatbread Melt (2.29)- A quesadilla with thick chewy bread. I would say to get it extra grilled to get it all warm because they didn’t grill it at mine. Nothing really special but pretty good. 6/10\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Chicken Enchilada Burrito (2.59)- For being one of the pricier options on the menu, i didn’t think it was worth the price. None of the flavors really stood out and it kinda tasted like a cheese roll with a little kick. I think grilled with a lot of extra Red Sauce would really boost this up the list. 5/10\n",
